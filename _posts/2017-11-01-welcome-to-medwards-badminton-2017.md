Heya! Welcome to Murray Edwards Badminton Club!

Our badminton club welcomes all players, whether you simply need a break from work, want to learn a new sport or are interested in competing for the college. We have two college teams playing inter-college matches. The teams are captained by Angel (mkm43) and Sophie (slb210). 

There are two training sessions every week: 14.30-16.30 on Saturday and 14.00-15.00 on Sunday from 7th Oct to 26 Nov (for Michealmas Term 2017). The sessions take place at [St Luke’s Barn](https://goo.gl/maps/M2mo6JkAQPq). The training times might change if our teams have matches at that time.Emails will be sent out every week about training time. We have some rackets here and we will provide the shuttlecocks, but if you have your own rackets, feel free to bring it with you!

Don’t worry if you are not confident in your skills, I am very sure that after taking some practice you will master at it!

We have matches every week with other colleges, so if you are interested in playing in our matches, just contact one of our captains!

Angel
