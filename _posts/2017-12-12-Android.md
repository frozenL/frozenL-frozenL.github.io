I'm stuck in a Frankfurt Airport Hotel and I'm so bored that I decided to do the Android coding corse.

Notes:

* Menu inflation: e.g.
```java
    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.forcast, menu);
```
* [StackOverflow: LinearLayout vs FrameLayout](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34540571/is-it-fine-to-use-linearlayout-instead-of-framelayout)
* Adapter: 
> The adapter does create ViewHolder objects and inflates item views in its onCreateViewHolder function, it also returns the number of items in the data source, and binds data from the data source to each item (even if we pass the responsibility to the ViewHolder). It doesn't cache views associated with each item (that's the job of the ViewHolder class) nor does it recycle them; thatâ€™s what our RecyclerView does." -- Udacity
