week 1: parallel computing
---
<details><div markdown="1">
- def:  
  a type of computation in which many calculations are performed at the same time
- vs. concurrent programming:
  - parallel:  
    uses parallel hardware to execute computation more quickly. => Efficiency
  - concurrent:  
    may or may not execute multiple executions at the same time. => modularity, responsiveness
- granularity levels:
  - bit-level
  - instruction-level
  - task-level
- parallel hardware:
  - multi-core processors
  - symmetric multiprocessors
  - GPU
  - FPGA
  - computer clusters
- threads:  
  each process can contain multiple independent concurrency units called threads (sharing the same memory address space)
  ```scala
  class HelloThread extends Thread {
    override def run() {
      println("hello world!")
    }
  }
  val t = new HelloThread
  t.start()
  t.join()
  ```
  when t.join(), the main thread blocks until HelloThread finishes.
- atomicity
  - the synchronized block
    ```scala
    private val x = new AnyRef{}
    private var uidCount = 0L
    def getUniqueId(): Long = x.synchronized {
      uidCound = uidCount + 1
      uidCount
    }
    ```
  - composition with the synchronized block
    ```scala
    class Account(private var amount: Int = 0) {
      def transfer(target: Account, n: Int) =
        this.synchronized {
          target.synchronized {
            this.amount -= n
            target.amount += n
          }
        }
    }
    ```
- deadlock
  - resolving deadlocks:  
    always acquire resources in the same order
- memory model:  
  a set of rules that describes how threads interact when accessing shared memory
  - two threads writing to separate locations in memory do not need synchronization
  - a thread X that calls ```join``` on another thread Y is guaranteed to observe all the writes by thread Y after ```join``` returns
- running computations in parallel:
  ```scala
  parallel(e1, e2)
  ```
  - Monte Carlo method to estimate Pi
    ```scala
    def monteCarloPiPar(iter: Int): Double = {
      val ((pi1, pi2), (pi3, pi4) = parallel(
        parallel(mcCount(iter/4), mcCount(iter/4)),
        parallel(mcCount(iter/4), mcCount(iter - 3 * (iter / 4)))
      ))
      4.0 * (pi1 + pi2 + pi3 + pi4) / iter
    }
    ```
- first-class tasks
  ```scala
  val t1 = task(e1)
  val t2 = task(e2)
  val v1 = t1.join
  val v2 = t2.join
  ```

week 2: basic task parallel algorithms

<details><div markdown="1">
- parallel sorting
  ```scala
  def sort(from: Int, until: Int, depth: Int): Unit = {
    if(depth == maxDepth) {
      quickSort(xs, from, until - from)
    } else {
      val mid = (from + until) / 2
      parallel(sort(mid, until, depth + 1) , sort(from, mid, depth + 1))
      val flip = (maxDepth - depth) % 2 == 0
      val src = if(flip) ys else xs
      val dst = if(flip) xs else ys
      merge(src, dst, from, mid, until)
    }
  }
  sort(0, xs.length, 0)
  ```
- parallel fold operation
  - fold:  
    unable to enable parallel operations due to non-associative operations
    ```scala
    List(1, 3, 8).fold(100)((s, x) => s + x)
    ```
  - foldLeft, foldRight, reduceLeft, reduceRight
- associative operations
  - definition:  
    Operation ```f: (A, A) => A``` is associative iff for every x, y, z:  
    f(x, f(y, z)) = f(f(x, y), z)
  - commutative:  
    Operation ```f: (A, A) => A``` is commutative iff for every x, y:  
    f(x, y) = f(y, x)
- parallel scan left
</div></details>

week 3: data-parallelism
---
<details><div markdown="1">
as opposed to task-parallelism
- definition:  
  a form of parallelism that distributes data across computing nodes.
- data-parallelism programming model
  ```scala
  def initializeArray(xs: Array[Int])(v: Int): Unit = {
    for(i <- (0 until xs.length).par) {
      xs(i) = v
    }
  }
  ```
- operations
  - e.g.
    ```scala
    (1 until 1000).par
      .filter(n => n % 3 == 0)
      .count(n => n.toString == n.toString.reverse)
    ```
    - fold
      ```scala
      def sum(xs: Array[Int]): Int = {
        xs.par.fold(0)(_ + _)
      } 
      ```
      - preconditions:
        - ```f(a, f(b,c)) == f(f(a, b), c)```
        - ```f(z, a) == f(a, z) == a```

week 4: data structures for parallel computing

- conc-tree data structure:
  - conc-tree: balanced tree
